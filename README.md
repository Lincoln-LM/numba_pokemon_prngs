# numba_pokemon_prngs
Package for numba @jitclass implementations (optionally uncompiled but with integers and arrays handled by numpy) of the Pseudo-Random Number Generators used in the Pokemon series

Contents are *heavily* based on implementations found in [Pok√©Finder](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/PokeFinder)

## Installation
numba-pokemon-prngs can be installed via pip with the following command

```pip install "numba-pokemon-prngs[numba] @ git+https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/numba_pokemon_prngs"```

or without numba support

```pip install "numba-pokemon-prngs @ git+https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/numba_pokemon_prngs"```

if numba is not detected, either by not being installed or for some other reason, numba-pokemon-prngs will default to relying only on numpy (as specified in [compilation.py](https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/numba_pokemon_prngs/blob/master/numba_pokemon_prngs/compilation.py), and will log a warning unless the environment variable ``NPP_USE_NUMBA`` is set to "FALSE" (or any value other than "TRUE").

This environment variable can additionally be used to trigger numba-less mode even when numba is installed.

additionally wheels for the latest commit are provided for direct installation at https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/numba_pokemon_prngs/releases/tag/latest

and can be installed to micropip for [pyodide](https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/numba_pokemon_prngs/blob/master/numba_pokemon_prngs/compilation.py) via

```micropip.install("numba_pokemon_prngs-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl")```

after pulling the latest build from https://github.com/Lincoln-LM/numba_pokemon_prngs/releases/download/latest/numba_pokemon_prngs-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
